Hey there! I'm @andrew-erasmus, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm all about learning and bringing cool ideas to life. Currently, I'm focusing on the full stack JavaScript, honing my skills to create awesome web applications. I am also diving into some other tehcnologies so that I can gain experience in other areas.

What you'll find in my profile:

ðŸš€ Projects: A few sites to practice my web development skills and some other projects I've been working on.

ðŸ’¡ Experiments: A couple projects to test out different algorithms and technologies that I'm interested in. 

ðŸŒ± Ideas in Progress: Some random things that I've been tinkering with and using to grow my skills.

ðŸ“¨ If you want to get in touch, drop me an email at andrew.r.eras@gmail.com. I'm always up for a chat, collaboration, or just a friendly hello. ðŸ˜„

ðŸ‘‹ Thanks for stopping by!
